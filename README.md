What is QUnit

QUnit is a powerful JavaScript unit testing framework that helps you to debug code. It's written by members of the jQuery team, and is the official test suite for jQuery. But QUnit is general enough to test any regular JavaScript code, and it's even able to test server-side JavaScript via some JavaScript engine like Rhino or V8.
If you're unfamiliar with the idea of “unit testing”, don't worry. It's not too difficult to understand:
In computer programming, unit testing is a software verification and validation method in which a programmer tests if individual units of source code are fit for use. A unit is the smallest testable part of an application. In procedural programming a unit may be an individual function or procedure.
This is quoted from Wikipedia. Simply put, you write tests for each functionality of your code, and if all of these tests are passed, you can be sure that the code will be bug-free (mostly, depends on how thorough your tests are).
